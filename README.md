# vic2-srm
A lightweight mod for Victoria 2 to allow you to research and build factories that produce (artifical) late resources.

## Raison d’être
If you run as a hyper-industrialized economy, you will inevitably be starved for late game crucial resources (coal, rubber, steel, sulfur,...). Even cornering all crucial RGO regions in the world will not help you. However, in real life, by the late game (1910s-1920s) techonolgically we already have synthetic rubbers, petroleum coke, artifical fertilizers, and the like. Seeing that the concept of factory taking one industrial resource and turn it into another already exist in the game (synthetic oil and dye), I decided to expand it to other resources.

## What does it do?
For now I set it up so that you can produce sythetic rubber from oil. The process is set up so that the factory have a bit of profit doing it so that you can run it in Lassie-fairez economies and does not have to rely on subsidies, but cannot beat the good old rubber plantations so as to not discourage expansion. You also need good access to cheap oil to do this; I have not calculated if oil sourced from coal will work economically but in my intent it should not.

## How to use
Extract the SRM into the mod folder of Victoria II, then enable it in the mod loader.

It should be able to add to current game and coexist with vanilla techonogies and not force you to run a new "game" ala Victoria Universalis or GFM.

## Future plan
I plan to extend this to coal and fertilizer/sulfur. Those are on the short list of resources I always found lacking in the late game period, especially when you are inclined to build a massive industrial empire like me.
